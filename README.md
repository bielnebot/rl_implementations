# Reinforcement learning implementations

This repository contains the implementation of two RL algorithms: Proximal Policy Optimization and Deep Q Learning both from scratch (with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)) and using the [TorchRL](https://pytorch.org/rl/stable/index.html) library.

The environment is the car racing simulation from OpenAI's Gym package.
